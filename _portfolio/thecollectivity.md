  Collectivity is a platform that allows people from all around the world to
  colaborate and share their professional expertise in order to improve health
  systems. Check out our case study to see how Naturaily contributed to changing

step-one-title: Helping health systems
step-one-text: >-
  Africa’s health systems are underdeveloped. They lack proper design,
  implementation and evaluation of policies. What would have positive impact?
  Professionals who cooperate, share their experience and knowledge. Five years
  ago such group met and made a sad discovery - the potential is there, but
  there’s no place to share insights and organize cooperation. That’s where
  Naturaily enters the scene to help build online community solution.
step-two-title: It’s all about communities and projects

step-two-text: >-
  Naturaily has created a community website that makes communication and
  cooperation much easier. Two key sections of the website are Activities and
  Communities.<br><br>Activities are all about projects and flash consultations.
  Community members either take on bigger projects and use the site to
  communicate and come up with solutions or take part in flash consultations
  which are easier to organize and aim to quickly solve simple issues in a
  Reddit-like manner. For projects one needs to be accepted by project manager
  whereas flash consultations are open for everybody.<br><br>Communities are
  focused on discussions and resources. Each community can discuss issues and
  store resources on its page. Links to projects and community experts’ profiles
  are stored on the community page as well.

step-three-text: >-
  Collectivity is a regular Ruby on Rails application. It’s been developed with
  responsive web design approach in mind which means it’s ready to be used on
  mobile devices. It utilizes Backbone.js and HTML5. AWS S3 service has been
  chosen for storing files.<br><br>Sophisticated set of tools has been used to
  enable smooth development and deployment process. Among them Jenkins with
  plugins for continuous integration and ensuring code quality, Docker for
  deployment.<br><br>Project has been managed using Kanban methodology.

  Naturaily’s exceptional reactivity makes them a valuable development partner.
  Another advantage is their ability to communicate well with non-technical
  people. While they could maybe improve their schedule estimates, they
  consistently hit deadlines and deliver clever solutions.
