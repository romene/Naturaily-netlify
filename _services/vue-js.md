  applications
tech-head: What is Vue.js?
tech-desc-one: >-
  Vue.js is a JavaScript framework, created by an ex-developer at Google - Evan
  You. He’s goal was to take features and concepts he enjoyed using from Angular
  and build a lightweight framework around them.
tech-desc-two: >-
  This so-called ‘progressive framework’ launched less than a year after
  Facebook’s React and has been getting quite a lot of attention from both
  developers and companies ever since. So, what makes this framework so special?
  Let’s look at Vue.js’ advantages.

advantage-subtitle: Why is it worth to choose Vue.js development?
advantage-desc-one-title: Lightweight
advantage-desc-one: >-
  Vue.js progressive framework weight can be shrunk down to 18 Kb! For
  comparison, React weights almost twice as much. It means that your application
  will be extremely lightweight and performant. Oh, and Vue.js applications take
  far less code than React.js.
advantage-desc-two-title: Agile development
advantage-desc-two: >-
  Vue makes the development process extremely fast. Developers find its syntax
  very intuitive, what makes the debugging and working with the framework
  effortless. It is a great framework for companies looking for fast and smooth
  development.
advantage-desc-three-title: Flexibility
advantage-desc-three: >-
  Vue is a less opinionated solution compared to its competition. It allows your
  project to be the exact way you want it to be. You can either build an entire
  Single Page Application from the ground up or just integrate Vue in your
  already existing app.
advantage-desc-four-title: Performant
advantage-desc-four: >-
  Vue.js is one of the most performant JavaScript frameworks. It is much faster
  than its competitors - React or Angular, meaning that if the performance of
  your application is a key factor, you should definitely go with Vue.

        LVCloud was designed to detect sudden changes such as increased humidity
        or worn out cables so that engineers could be informed about a possible
        malfunction as soon as possible.
