Some movies are full of great pieces of advice for entrepreneurs and startup builders. Below you will find some of my favourite examples.


## 1. Fight Club
>Stop trying to control everything and just let go! LET GO!

You can’t build a company by micromanaging employees and overlooking every process. Start finding the right people for the job and let them handle things!


## 2. Devil’s Advocate
>**John Milton:** Are we negotiating?
>**Kevin Lomax:** Always!

Remember: you are constantly in tug-of-war with your employees, clients and subcontractors. Always.

## 3. The Hunt for Red October
>Listen, I'm a politician which means I'm a cheat and a liar, and when I'm not kissing babies I'm stealing their lollipops. But it also means I keep my options open.

You may need to change your opinion or decision and your startup’s existence will depend on this. It may hurt someone. You will be labeled a hypocrite. Grow thick skin.

## 4. Bullitt
>**Walter Chalmers:** Frank, we must all compromise.
>**Bullitt:** Bullshit.

![bullitt](/assets/images/bullitt.jpg "Bullitt")

Although sometimes compromise is the best choice, you will find yourself in situations when it just won’t be an option. If you compromise, you’ll just trade chance to succeed for agony.

## 5. The Ninth Gate
>There's nothing more reliable than a man whose loyalty can be bought for hard cash.

![theninthgate](/assets/images/the-ninth-gate.jpg "The Ninth Gate")

Not everybody is motivated by money. It’s your task to guess what turns them on to delivering great results. It’s much easier with experts motivated by money. Expensive, but efficient.

## 6. Carlito’s Way
>Favor gonna kill you faster than a bullet.

![thecarlitosway](/assets/images/carlitos-way.jpg "Carlito’s Way")

This may seem a little strange when you consider latest writing from Paul Graham. But trust me and be cautious with favors. You’re building a company, not a charity. Time for charity will come later.

## 7. H.E.A.T.
>I do what I do best, I take scores. You do what you do best, try to stop guys like me.

![heat](/assets/images/heat.jpg "H.E.A.T")

Early on you’ll need to wear many hats. But let them go as soon as you can afford to hire someone better than you. You just focus on doing what you’re best at.

## 8. Master and Commander
>The only things that keep this wooden world together are hard work...

![masterandcommander](/assets/images/master-and-commander.jpg "Master and Commander")

Hard work. Perspiration. Be prepared for this.

## 9. Big Lebowski
>I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. You know, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing.

![biglebowski](/assets/images/big-lebowski.jpg "Big Lebowski")

Have your own style. Differentiate from others. Your personal brand can help your startup take off the ground.

## 10. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon
>**Someone:** Do you think you are a real master?
>**Li:** Like most things, I am nothing.
>It's the same for this sword.  All
of it is simply a state of mind.

![Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon](/assets/images/crouching-tiger.jpg "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon")

You are just stardust and although you’re weak, you can achieve just anything!
