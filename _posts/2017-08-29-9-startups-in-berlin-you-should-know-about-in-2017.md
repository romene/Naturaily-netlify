## <a href="https://www.smacc.io/en/" class="inline-image" alt="SMACC" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/smacc.png"></a> - AI-enabled financial management


Smacc’s goal is to make financial management as simple and affordable as possible. Its target is small and medium-sized enterprises for which Smacc offers a platform to digitize and automate accounting and financial processes. The company uses machine learning to improve the automation process and provide real time financial transparency.

The estimated value of Smacc for June 2016 is €14M - €21M, according to [dealroom.co](https://app.dealroom.co/companies/smacc/).

## <a href="https://getgrover.com/de-en/" class="inline-image" alt="Grover" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/grover.png"></a> - subscribe to tech instead of buying it

This rather unusual idea launched in June 2015 in Berlin by name ByeBuy. Currently, the service offers a wide variety of products to rent at an affordable monthly fee - from MacBooks, GoPros to drones and smartphones. The fee is roughly 5 percent of the retail price, making technology accessible to everyone. In theory, users can rent electronics for a month and try before they buy.


Recently Grover launched in the U.S. significantly increasing their range of regional development. The company has up to 50 employees, the estimated valuation of the startup is unknown - Grover reached out to us to correct the information from [dealroom.co](https://dealroom.co/) we used because they have never revealed this amount.

## <a href="https://www.helloclue.com/" class="inline-image" alt="Clue" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/clue.png"></a> - platform for female health

Clue helps women discover the unique patterns of their menstrual cycle by allowing them to input information how they are feeling during their period when they have it, their sexual activity, flow, and other notes. Recently, the app’s functionality included, what the company calls, “Smart Pill Tracing” - Clue asks women to tell the app whether they took their pill that day if it was taken late or completely missed.

Berlin-based Clue has closed a $7 million Series A round with investment from New York’s Union Square Ventures and London-based Series A fund Mosaic Ventures, which gives Clue’s total $10 million in funds.

Clue has been approached by multiple universities interested in working with data gathered by the app on studies around female reproductive health issues. Ida Tin - co-founder of Clue - says that they are working with universities like Stanford, Columbia in New York, University of Utah and Washington University.

## <a href="https://kontist.com/en" class="inline-image" alt="Kontist" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/kontist.png"></a> - mobile bank account for freelancers

Can a fight bring something good to this world? Apparently the answer is yes! The concept of the Kontist app was born out of one entrepreneur’s fight with banks. Kontist co-founder and CEO Christopher Plantener designed a new bank account specifically for freelancers. Its goal is to automate 80% of all banking and bookkeeping processes for freelancers and also to automatically calculate taxes and set them aside.

Plantener’s efforts to motivate banks to start offering special deals and services for freelancers were unsuccessful, so he solved this issues himself. He created a team of freelancers to make solutions for freelancers.

Kontist’s app gives self-employed people independence by providing a real-time overview of spending and full control over their own finances, read about it [here](https://www.founders.as/news/kontist-launches-mobile-bank-account-with-built-in-finance-manager).

The fabric, used to make the shirts, has two layers and protects the user from RFID skimmers. Even though the Kickstarter campaign was a failure, the company still lets people sign up for an early bird of the product.

The launch date is unknown.

“ResearchGate is an innovative and widely-used platform, which connects researchers with their peers around the world.

## <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/" class="inline-image" alt="Startups" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/soundcloud.png"></a> - the most popular music streaming service

SoundCloud got popular years before anyone has heard about Spotify or Tidal. People praised it for its “rebelliousness” and free to listen user-generated content. Recently, multiple reports suggest that the site is in trouble because of the lack of funding and proper monetizing model making the future of the service unknown. We covered some of the mistakes made by SoundCloud’s management in this [article](http://naturaily.com/blog/post/from-1b-valuation-to-rescue-plan-what-have-happened-to-soundcloud-and-why).

SoundCloud is definitely on our “watch-list” of 2017.

SoundCloud has 40M users (2013) and 175 million unique monthly listeners (2014).
