So you have founded a startup. It wasn’t easy, was it?

How about making your work a little bit easier? Don’t let tedious and recurring tasks drive you away from launching a successful product. You’ve got more important things to do than individually keeping an eye on every team member just to make sure they are doing their job, right?

Don’t make your already difficult work even more difficult. In this post we’ve prepared a list of tools that will make your and yours team job much easier, faster and productive. Some of them are loosely about collaboration and management but bare with me, they will certainly **help you with your everyday work**. ‘Cause no one wants to work hard, right?

Let’s jump into the best online tools for startups, management and collaboration.

Amazing tools for startups you’ve probably never heard of.

Now that we have those out of the way, let’s dive deep into some **obvious ones that are extremely useful**. I have also included most popular alternatives if you’re looking for some new things for you or your team.

## Trello

Trello is a web-based project management application that can significantly improve the workflow of your team. Create cards, fill them with tasks and assign your team members to them. Simple, easy and convenient, just like an online whiteboard. This solution is extremely popular among not only development teams, but also schools and real estate agents.

**Alternatives for Trello:**
Asana, Basecamp and recently released Microsoft TFS.

## Google Tools

If you want to save up some money for the Microsoft Office 365 license you might want to try out Google services such as Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. They offer quite a lot of features considering they are free, web-based applications.

The best thing about them is the way how a team of people can work on one project. You can instantly see changes made by other team members, comment them or even chat. It’s great for light document editing, but surprisingly whole service is highly customizable - check out how we [use Google Sheets to track working hours with Breeze](https://naturaily.com/blog/google-sheets-breeze-time-tracker).

Google also offers other interesting tools for marketing and SEO such as Google Analytics, Trends, AdWords.

**Alternatives for Google Suite:**
Microsoft Office 365 with OneDrive is a much more sophisticated, but premium solution that offers similar collaboration experience to Google’s.

## LastPass - Password Manager

Simplify your life with a password manager. If you want to give your employees access to one company account eg. analytics or e-learning platform, but you don’t want your password to fly around Slack channels, you should consider using a password manager such as LastPass. The service can hook up accounts of your employees to the core one where the passwords and the logins are being stored. It allows them to simply and securely login to accounts of your choice that are used by many people.

**Alternatives for LastPass:**
Sticky notes on the edge of your computer screen, Dashlane, Keeper.
