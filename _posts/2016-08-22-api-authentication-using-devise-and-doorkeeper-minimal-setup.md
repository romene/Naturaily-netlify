Have you ever tried to setup Devise and Doorkeeper in the simplest possible way, without oauth applications etc? Here it is! In this article, I'll show you in a few easy steps that setup you searched for!

Let’s start by creating new, simple Rails application (or clone this one https://github.com/Naturaily/devise-doorkeeper).


1. ```rails new myapp```
2. ```cd myapp```
3. ```rails g scaffold items name:string description:text```
4. ```rake db:migrate```
5. add ```root to: 'items#index'``` to ```config/routes.rb```

Now we have a simple app with Items CRUD. Let’s add some code to handle Users.

1. add ```gem 'devise'``` to Gemfile and run ```bundle install```
2. ```rails g devise:install```
3. ```rails g devise User```
4. ```rake db:migrate```
5. ```add before_action :authenticate_user!``` to ```items_controller```

OK, only logged in users can CRUD items now. Off to the most exciting part. We want the very same feature on the API, because mobile app is being created. We want the Items CRUD available and we will authenticate every action using Doorkeeper for this, because it’s the easiest thing you can do.

Let’s install Doorkeeper.


1. add ```gem 'doorkeeper'``` to Gemfile and run ```bundle install```
2. ```rails g doorkeeper:install```
3. ```rails g doorkeeper:migration```


Now edit that new migration, it should look like this:

```ruby
class CreateDoorkeeperTables < ActiveRecord::Migration
 def change
   create_table :oauth_access_tokens do |t|
     t.integer  :resource_owner_id
     t.integer  :application_id
     t.string   :token,                  null: false
     t.string   :refresh_token
     t.integer  :expires_in
     t.datetime :revoked_at
     t.datetime :created_at,             null: false
     t.string   :scopes
   end

   add_index :oauth_access_tokens, :token, unique: true
   add_index :oauth_access_tokens, :resource_owner_id
   add_index :oauth_access_tokens, :refresh_token, unique: true
   add_foreign_key(
     :oauth_access_tokens,
     :users,
     column: :resource_owner_id
   )
 end
end
```

We removed ```oauth_applications``` and ```oauth_access_grants``` tables (we simply don’t need them). We need to remove associated foreing keys and indexes too. I also removed previous_refresh_token field from ```oauth_access_tokens``` table (please read the comment generated by Doorkeeper). And there is a little hack too. We need to change
	```t.references :application, null: false```
to
	```t.integer :application_id```
Without that our example won’t work!

Now we can run migrations

```ruby
rake db:migrate
```

We need to mount doorkeeper in our router. It can be easily done by ```use_doorkeeper``` method. But we should rembember that we need nothing but tokens! So our code in ```config/routes.rb``` can looks like the code below:

```ruby
use_doorkeeper do
  skip_controllers :authorizations, :applications,
    :authorized_applications
end
```

Now let’s integrate Doorkeeper with Devise. First, we need a method to find user by email and password. Let’s edit ```app/models/user.rb```.

```ruby
 class << self
   def authenticate(email, password)
     user = User.find_for_authentication(email: email)
     user.try(:valid_password?, password) ? user : nil
   end
 end
```

Next we configure Doorkeeper in ```config/initializers/doorkeeper.rb``` to use this method.

```ruby
 resource_owner_from_credentials do |_routes|
   User.authenticate(params[:email], params[:password])
 end
```

Don’t forget to let Doorkeeper access token with a password.

```ruby
 grant_flows %w(password)
```

We also want refresh tokens, so we need to uncomment the line with ```use_refresh_token```.

Next, we skip app authorization.

```ruby
 skip_authorization do
   true
 end
```

There we go! We can now log in and log out to our API. Try this (please remember to keep the server launched):

```bash
curl -X POST -d "grant_type=password&email=user@example.com&password=yourpassword" localhost:3000/oauth/token
```

```bash
{"access_token”:”YourAccessToken”,”token_type":"bearer","expires_in":7200,"refresh_token”:”YourRefreshToken”,”created_at":1470946931}%
```

DON’T FORGET TO USE SSL on production and staging environments!

OK, it’s time to use our tokens! Let’s retrieve some Items from our API. How? We need two new controllers. Why two? Because we should have separate controllers for API, so we need ItemsController and base controller for API.

We need ```app/controllers/api/base_controller.rb```, a really simple one.

```ruby
class Api::BaseController < ActionController::API
  respond_to :json
end
```

And ```app/controller/api/items_controller.rb``` (exemplary implementation).

```ruby
class Api::ItemsController < Api::BaseController
  before_action :doorkeeper_authorize! # equivalent of authenticate_user!

  def index
    @items = Item.all
    respond_with @items
  end

  # the rest of actions
end
```

The most important part of code here is ```before_action :doorkeeper_authorize!```. ```doorkeeper_authorize!``` is equaivalent of ```authenticate_user!```. Without that every user could CRUD ours items.

The last one thing: add a new route

```ruby
namespace :api do
  resources :items
end
```

And that’s it! Let’s give it a try.

```bash
curl -v localhost:3000/api/items
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
```

```bash
curl -v localhost:3000/api/items?access_token=OurAccessTokenReturnedByAPI
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[{"id":1,"name":"Item","description":"Amazing Item.","created_at":"2016-08-11T19:25:09.649Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T19:25:09.649Z"}]
```

It works! Yay!

Is that all? Definitely no! We still don’t have registration via API. But there’s no need to describe it here, someone else has done that already. Please check [this](http://blog.andrewray.me/how-to-set-up-devise-ajax-authentication-with-rails-4-0/) post.

Goodbye and good luck!
